# Nosh -- some things are better shared

## Inspiration Behind the Nosh Application

"Millennials spend 44% of their food dollars - or \$2,921 annually - on eating out, according to the Food Institute's analysis of the United States Department of Agriculture's food expenditure data from 2014. That represents a 10.7 percent increase from prior data points in 2010."&nbsp;<sup>[1][1]</sup>

### General Marketing Stats

1. Over 1 billion restaurant visits by consumers are influenced by online marketing (Monetate).
2. Out of all industries, consumers read restaurant reviews more than any other industry (Bright Local).
3. Since 84% of people trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations for dining decisions, it's key you have a bunch of positive reviews (Bright Local).

The "Nosh Team" realized the need for locating food via mobile & web applications. Our love for food and tech gave us the inspiration for Nosh.
