#Nosh

Nosh is an app to help find local food to eat. It is similar to what is used to available in the Urban Sppon application. Similarly, it uses Zomato for the resturant data and will use the Brower location to help narrow the choices. Users will be able to choose from any/all of Category/Cuisine, distance and price point. One the choice is made, the application will return a suggestion based on selections. Users will be able to create profiles in order to save favorite selections, write reviews or set other preferences.
